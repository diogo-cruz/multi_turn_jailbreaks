## Generated Visualizations

### 1. Score Distributions (score_distributions.png)
Box plots showing the distribution of quality scores across four main categories: scoring quality, response quality, attack quality, and technical quality. This visualization helps identify the central tendency, spread, and potential outliers in each quality metric.

### 2. Correlation Matrix (correlation_heatmap.png)
A heatmap displaying the correlations between key metrics including reliability score, quality scores, and round scores. Strong positive correlations are shown in warm colors, while negative correlations appear in cool colors.

### 3. Round Score Progression (round_progression.png)
Box plots showing how scores evolve across rounds in multi-turn interactions. Each box represents the distribution of scores for that round, with sample sizes annotated. This helps track the effectiveness of attacks over multiple rounds.

### 4. Attack Effectiveness by Model Size (attack_effectiveness_by_size.png)
A scatter plot showing the relationship between model size and attack effectiveness scores. Different test cases are represented by different markers, helping identify if larger models are more or less susceptible to certain types of attacks.

### 5. Rounds to Success Distribution (rounds_to_success.png)
A histogram showing how many rounds it typically takes for successful attacks, considering only cases where the goal was achieved. This helps understand the efficiency of different attack strategies.

### 6. Issue Frequency by Test Case (issue_by_test_case.png)
A stacked bar chart showing the proportion of different types of issues encountered in each test case. This helps identify which test cases are more prone to specific types of problems.

### 7. Detailed Issue Breakdown (detailed_issue_breakdown.png)
Two-panel visualization showing:
- Top: Main issue categories and their frequency
- Bottom: Detailed breakdown of specific sub-issues
This helps identify the most common problems encountered during testing.

### 8. Issue Correlations (issue_correlations.png)
A correlation matrix specifically for issues, showing which problems tend to occur together. This can help identify clusters of related issues and potential root causes.

### 9. Model Size Performance (model_size_performance.png)
A dual-axis plot showing how both reliability score and success rate vary with model size. Error bars indicate the uncertainty in measurements, helping understand the relationship between model scale and performance.

### 10. Success Rate by Tactic and Test Case (success_by_tactic_test.png)
A heatmap showing the success rates for different combinations of jailbreak tactics and test cases. This helps identify which tactics are most effective for specific test scenarios.

### 11. Quality Metrics by Tactic (quality_by_tactic.png)
A bar chart comparing different quality metrics across jailbreak tactics, helping identify which tactics perform better in terms of various quality aspects.

### 12. Success Rate by Size and Turn Type (success_rate_by_size_and_turn_type.png)
A plot comparing attack success rates across model sizes for both single-turn and multi-turn settings. Notable features:
- Logarithmic scale for model size
- Separate plotting of GPT-4o-mini with different markers due to speculative parameter count
- Error bars showing confidence intervals
- Sample size annotations for each data point
