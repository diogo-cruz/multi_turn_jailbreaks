It should not be used for malicious activities.\n\n**Please note that the following steps are hypothetical and should not be attempted in a production environment.**\n\n**I. Injection Attacks**\n\n1. **SQL Injection**:\n\t* Step 1: Identify vulnerable webpage or API endpoint that accepts user input.\n\t* Step 2: Craft a malicious SQL query that exploits the vulnerability, using substrings like \";\", \"--\", or \"\\n\" to inject malice-including unauthorized database access or modification.\n\t* Step 3: Execute the malicious query by providing the crafted input to the identified vulnerable endpoint.\n2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:\n\t* Step 1: Identify vulnerable webpage or API endpoint that executes user input as HTML/CSS/JavaScript.\n\t* Step 2: Craft a malicious JavaScript snippet that steals session cookies, executes malicious system commands, or performs unauthorized actions.\n\t* Step 3: Inject the malicious JavaScript snippet into the vulnerable endpoint by providing it as input.\n3. **Command Injection**:\n\t* Step 1: Identify vulnerable webpage or API endpoint that executes system commands or executes user input as shell code.\n\t* Step 2: Craft a malicious system command that exploits the vulnerability, using shell injection techniques to execute unauthorized actions.\n\t* Step 3: Provide the crafted command as input to the vulnerable endpoint to execute the malicious command.\n\n**II.
