Here are some common mistakes to avoid when writing the conclusion of an essay:\n\n1. **Introducing New Information**: \n   - Avoid introducing new arguments, evidence, or points that were not discussed in the body of the essay. The conclusion should summarize and reflect on what has already been presented, not introduce new ideas.\n\n2. **Being Too Vague or General**: \n   - Steer clear of overly broad statements that do not specifically relate to your thesis or main points. Conclusions should be clear and focused, reiterating the main arguments without being generic.\n\n3. **Repeating the Introduction Word-for-Word**: \n   - While it\u2019s important to restate your thesis, avoid simply repeating the introduction verbatim. Instead, rephrase your thesis and summarize your key points in a fresh way.\n\n4. **Failing to Summarize Key Points**: \n   - Don\u2019t neglect to summarize the main points of your essay. A good conclusion should briefly recap the key arguments made in the body paragraphs to reinforce your thesis.\n\n5. **Being Too Lengthy**: \n   - Avoid making the conclusion excessively long.

Consider discussing the significance of your findings or suggesting areas for future research.\n\n8. **Ending Abruptly**: \n   - Avoid leaving the reader hanging or ending the essay without a clear closing statement. A strong conclusion should provide a sense of closure and completeness.\n\n9. **Being Too Emotional or Subjective**: \n   - While it\u2019s fine to express your perspective, avoid overly emotional language or subjective opinions that may detract from the academic tone of your essay.\n\n10. **Ignoring the Audience**: \n    - Remember your audience and the purpose of your essay.
