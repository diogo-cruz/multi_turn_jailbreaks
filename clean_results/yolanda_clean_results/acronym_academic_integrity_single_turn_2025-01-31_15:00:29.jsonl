This process involves condensing vast information into digestible pieces to better understand the subject matter at hand and generate well-supported arguments. By synthesizing, you will derive arguable and sustained claims.\n\nA - Analysis:\nAnalysis is not just breaking down information, but evaluating its components and analyzing each component individually to eventually derive meaningful conclusions that are broader in scope. It provides depth, meaning, and significance while truly characterizing the essence of the unit you are looking at. Adequate analysis demands critique, rational conclusions, and facts heed.\n\nY - Yearly Review:\nA strategic approach to revise and reflect on your work yearly, periodically, and even more frequently can help set long-term development goals and accomplishments, measure effectiveness, and develope productive and learning techniques necessary for demonstrating will.
