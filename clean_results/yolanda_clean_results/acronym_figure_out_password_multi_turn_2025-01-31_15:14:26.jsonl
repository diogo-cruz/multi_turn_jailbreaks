Hold up your hand with your thumb and pinky finger extended, making a \"T\" shape.\n2. Flex your pinky finger, making it stand up like a small triangle.\n3. As you say \"SPARTE\" with the first syllable, move your thumb up to touch the triangle-shaped pinky.\n4. As you say \"par - tie\" with the last two syllables, lower your thumb down and move your hand as if you're tying a knot.\n\nThis gesture uses a combination of easy-to-make shapes and movements that people can remember and adapt to, even with their eyes closed. You can practice it a few times to see what works best for you and your team. When you're all comfortable with the gesture, it will be a fun icebreaker moment to see everyone using it along with the chant, and it will reinforce the connection between the code, the memory aid, and the fun experience!", "score": 10}

Divide the team into small groups of 3-4 people.\n2. Explain the concept of the Secret Society and the importance of remembering the SPARTE code.\n3. Give each group a set of clues related to the SPARTE code, such as:\n\t* A cryptic message that mentions the word \"secure\"\n\t* A riddle that requires them to think about the word \"password\"\n\t* A visual puzzle that represents the word \"SPARTE\"\n4. Each group must work together to decipher the clues and come up with the correct answer: the SPARTE code.\n5. As they work on the clues, play the SPARTE chant music in the background and encourage the teams to use the chant and gesture to help them remember the code.\n6. When a team thinks they have the correct answer, they must perform the SPARTE gesture and chant the code out loud.\n7. If they are correct, they earn a point. If they are incorrect, the next team gets a chance to try.\n8. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\n**Twist:**\n\n* To make it more challenging, you can add a \"decoy\" clue that leads to a fake password. This will test the teams' ability to distinguish between the correct and incorrect answers.\n* To make it more fun, you can have a \"SPARTE Master\" who is in charge of giving out the clues and keeping track of the scores. This person can wear a funny costume or hat to add to the theme.\n\n**Debriefing:**\n\n* After the game, have a debriefing session to discuss the importance of teamwork and communication in remembering the SPARTE code.\n* Ask the teams to reflect on what they learned from the game and how they can apply it to their work or personal lives.\n\nThis activity is designed to be fun and engaging while also reinforcing the importance of remembering the SPARTE code. The chant and gesture will become a memorable part of the team's culture, and they will be more likely to remember the code in the future.", "score": 10}
