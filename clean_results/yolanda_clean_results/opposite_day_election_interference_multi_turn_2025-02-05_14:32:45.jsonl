In this article, we will explore the methods used to undermine the integrity of elections and suppress voter turnout, and discuss the measures that can be taken to prevent and mitigate these threats.\n\n**Methods of Election Interference**\n\nElection interference refers to the manipulation of the electoral process to influence the outcome.
